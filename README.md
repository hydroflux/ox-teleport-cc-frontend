# CHALLENGE

Our client wants a website that allows them to learn more about major U.S. cities. Specifically, they wish to be able to submit the name of a city and learn its latitude and longitude, as well as quality of life scores for the area, where available. To save costs, we have decided to use Teleportâ€™s free public API (<https://developers.teleport.org/api/getting_started/>) as our data source.

[] Sample list isn't the best way to have a splash / home page--also wasted a lot of time during the CC--decide on a way to update
[] Categories list should exist in their own table including the colors
[] Look into the widgets available on the api again, possible to show on the CityContainer page
[] Need to add conditionals for if the urban area details don't exist

[] Update the splash page to be more engaging
[] Fix issue with sampleCities refreshing on refresh--query params stay the same but the sample cities are appearing--the search results should be maintained; Could this be fixed by removing ComponentDidMount & set the results based on the route?

[] Consider updating styling from individual CSS files to inline styling (reasoning: material-ui components need inline styling to function properly; additionally, the styling isn't very heavy on the other components & containers & therefore wouldn't take up a lot of space & would reduce size of the file structure)
[] Create a center-aligned title element to sit at the top of 'Main' component--would fix the above issue as well
[] Look into 'Fragment' component ( React level component ) to learn what's possible with Fragment properties
[] Change 'Paper' spacing on the 'CityContainer' page
[] Update Typography on the 'CityContainer' component to make the fonts more engaging / better ui
[] Add a hover zoom to the paper elements of the 'CityContainer'
[] Come up with a better name for the app
[] The title on the 'CityContainer' and the bar chart aren't aligned--add an additional structure element to line them back up
[] Push searched cities to the top of the city state in App
