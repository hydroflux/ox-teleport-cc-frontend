<!-- CHALLENGE -->
Our client wants a website that allows them to learn more about major U.S. cities. Specifically, they wish to be able to submit the name of a city and learn its latitude and longitude, as well as quality of life scores for the area, where available. To save costs, we have decided to use Teleportâ€™s free public API (https://developers.teleport.org/api/getting_started/) as our data source. 

<!-- August 24th Backlog Updates -->
[] Sample list isn't the best way to have a splash / home page--also wasted a lot of time during the CC--decide on a way to update
[] Categories list should exist in their own table including the colors
[] Look into the widgets available on the api again, possible to show on the CityContainer page
[] If continuing to use material-ui, update the CityContainer page to use the 'Paper' component in order to split the page into left / right (right side for widget)
[] Need to add conditionals for if the urban area details don't exist

<!-- August 25th Backlog Updates -->
[] Update the splash page to be more engaging
[] Fix issue with sampleCities refreshing on refresh--query params stay the same but the sample cities are appearing--the search results should be maintained; Could this be fixed by removing ComponentDidMount & set the results based on the route?
